Adding content to a page
========================

.. figure:: /images/add-text-plugin.png
   :figwidth: 400
   :align: right
   :figclass: clearfix

Your page is empty of course. We need to add some content to it, by adding a
*plugin*. In the toolbar, you'll notice that we're in *Content* mode. Change
that to *Structure* mode, using the :ref:`Structure/Content button
<structure-content-button>`.

This reveals the *placeholders* available on the page

On any placeholder, click the menu icon on the right side to reveal the list of
available plugins. In this case, we'll choose the *Text* plugin. Invoking the
*Text* plugin will open your installed text editor plugin. Enter some text and
press **Save**.

When you save the plugin, your plugin will now be displayed
"inside" the placeholder, as shown.

Previewing a page
=================

To preview the page, switch back to *Content* mode using the *Structure/Content
button* in the toolbar.

You can continue editing existing plugins in *Content* mode simply by
double-clicking the content they present. Try it: double-click on the text you
have just entered, and the text editor will open again for you to make some
more changes.

To add new plugins, or to re-arrange existing ones, switch back into *Structure*
mode.
