Create a page
#############


Select the *Pages...* menu item from the *Site menu* (*example.com* in the
example below, though yours may have a different name) in the toolbar.

.. figure:: /images/pages-menu-item.png
   :figwidth: 300
   :align: right

This reveals the :ref:`side-frame` for page administration.

.. figure:: /images/no-pages.png

Hit **Add page**.

.. figure:: /images/page-basic-settings.png
   :figwidth: 300
   :align: right
   :figclass: clearfix

You're now asked for some :ref:`basic settings <basic-page-settings>` for the
new page.

Just give it a ``Title`` - call it "Home". You can ignore the rest for now.

You will notice that the ``slug`` is completed automatically, based on the
``Title``.

When you are finished entering these fields, press **Save**. The *page editing
form* is replaced with the :ref:`page list <page-list>`. It's a short list: you
only have one item in it.

In the meantime to see the page you've just created, press *Home* in the page
list; it'll be displayed in the main frame:
